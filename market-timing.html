  <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-neutral-300">
    Selling mountain and rural properties in Central California requires careful timing, strategy, and market awareness. From Yosemite-adjacent ranches to foothill single-family homes, sellers must consider supply, demand, and lifestyle factors that influence property value.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">Market Trends & Timing</h2>
  <p class="mb-6 text-neutral-300">
    The mountain property market is cyclical but increasingly in demand as buyers seek privacy, open space, and lifestyle amenities. Seasonal trends matter: spring and summer months often see higher buyer interest, while winter may limit visibility but attract serious buyers seeking retreats.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">Buyer Profiles & Motivations</h2>
  <p class="mb-6 text-neutral-300">
    Understanding who your buyers are — second-home seekers, remote workers, ranch investors, or retirees — is crucial. Tailoring your marketing to these demographics increases the likelihood of attracting motivated buyers and achieving top dollar.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">Pricing Strategy</h2>
  <p class="mb-6 text-neutral-300">
    Accurate pricing is the cornerstone of a successful sale. Overpricing can stall interest, while strategic pricing can create competitive bidding. I use comparative market analysis, land utility evaluation, and local expertise to price mountain properties effectively.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">Preparing Your Property</h2>
  <p class="mb-6 text-neutral-300">
    First impressions matter. Proper landscaping, photography, drone footage, and highlighting unique features like access to lakes, trails, or views can dramatically increase perceived value.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">Marketing & Exposure</h2>
  <p class="mb-6 text-neutral-300">
    Multi-channel marketing — including professional photography, social media, email campaigns, and MLS exposure — ensures your property reaches the right audience. Highlighting lifestyle benefits, outdoor space, and scenic views is especially important for mountain properties.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">Negotiation & Closing</h2>
  <p class="mb-6 text-neutral-300">
    Skilled negotiation is key. I help sellers evaluate offers, manage contingencies, and navigate inspections to secure the highest net proceeds. Mountain properties often attract unique buyer requests, and preparation is everything.
