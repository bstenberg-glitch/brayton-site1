  <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-neutral-300">
    Madera County has become one of Central California’s most sought-after regions for ranches, acreage, and land development. From rolling hills near Yosemite to fertile plots in the valley, the opportunities are abundant — but so are the pitfalls for inexperienced buyers. Whether you’re a first-time land buyer, an investor seeking your next development opportunity, or a seasoned ranch owner, avoiding these common mistakes is critical for long-term success.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">1. Ignoring Zoning & Land Use Regulations</h2>
  <p class="mb-6 text-neutral-300">
    Many buyers assume that they can use land however they want — build a home, add a barn, or start a vineyard — without checking zoning restrictions. In Madera County, zoning determines permitted land uses, density, and even building materials in some areas. A property may look ideal, but without proper zoning, your vision could be blocked by law.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">2. Overlooking Access & Road Maintenance</h2>
  <p class="mb-6 text-neutral-300">
    Private land often comes with roads that require maintenance or may not be fully paved. Access easements, county road agreements, and seasonal closures can impact usability and property value. Always confirm how to legally access the property year-round and budget for potential road maintenance costs.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">3. Failing to Evaluate Utilities & Water</h2>
  <p class="mb-6 text-neutral-300">
    Water rights are often the most overlooked factor in Madera County land purchases. Determine if the property has water rights, well access, or restrictions that could limit development. Similarly, check availability of electricity, internet, and septic systems — lack of infrastructure can make land unusable without major investment.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">4. Skipping Soil & Topography Analysis</h2>
  <p class="mb-6 text-neutral-300">
    Not all land is equal. Rocky terrain, flood-prone areas, or steep slopes can prevent construction or make farming and ranching impractical. Hire a geotechnical engineer if needed to understand the soil, drainage, and slope before buying.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">5. Underestimating Development Costs</h2>
  <p class="mb-6 text-neutral-300">
    Many buyers price land only for the purchase itself, ignoring the true cost to make it functional: grading, fencing, well drilling, septic installation, permits, and building roads. Factor in these costs to avoid unpleasant surprises.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">6. Neglecting Long-Term Investment Considerations</h2>
  <p class="mb-6 text-neutral-300">
    Land should not just serve immediate needs but also long-term plans. Consider future development, resale value, and potential zoning changes. Madera County is growing quickly, so strategic purchases can yield exceptional ROI if approached wisely.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">7. Skipping Professional Guidance</h2>
  <p class="mb-6 text-neutral-300">
    Finally, don’t go it alone. Work with a local real estate professional who understands Madera County’s land market, permits, and investment dynamics. This ensures you avoid costly mistakes and navigate due diligence like a pro.
